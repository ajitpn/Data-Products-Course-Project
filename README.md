#About Storm data Explorer

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database tracks characteristics of major storms 
and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, 
and property damage. 

In the course project in "Reproducible Research" track, we had cleaned this data and grouped the different events into 11 broad
categories.

This application provides a facility to explore the cleaned data produced in the earlier project. The impact of storm data events
from 1995 to 2011 on population and economy can be viewed state wise and also yearwise.
